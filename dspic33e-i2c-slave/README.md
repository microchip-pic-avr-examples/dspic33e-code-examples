## Using I2C module as Slave device

## Description:

This code example shows how to use I2C module in slave mode.
To demonstrate it, dsPIC33E is used as I2C slave device.
The master I2C device uses the slave I2C device as RAM.
Thus master I2C device can read/write particular RAM area of I2C slave
device.
