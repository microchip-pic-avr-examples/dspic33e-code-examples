## Description:

In this example, ADC is configured to sample (AIN5) at 8Khz rate and converted data is assembled as 256 sample buffer before triggering filtering operation.

Timer 3 is setup to time-out every 125 microseconds (8Khz Rate). 
As a result, the module will stop sampling and trigger a 12-bit A/D conversion on every Timer3 time-out, i.e., Ts=125us. 
At that time, the conversion process starts and completes Tc=14*Tad periods later.
When the conversion completes, the module starts sampling again. However, since Timer3 
is already on and counting, about (Ts-Tc)us later, Timer3 will expire again and trigger 
next conversion. 

ADC module clock time period is configured as Tad=Tcy*(ADCS+1)= (1/40M)*64 = 1.6us (625Khz). 
Hence the conversion time for 12-bit A/D Conversion Time Tc=14*Tad = 22.4us

void initTmr3();
Timer 3 is configured to time-out at 8Khz rate. 

void initAdc1(void);
ADC module is set-up to convert AIN5 input using CH0 S/H on Timer 3 event in 12-bit mode.

void initDma0(void);
DMA channel 0 is configured in ping-pong mode to move the converted data from ADC to DMA RAM on every sample/convert sequence. 
It generates interrupt after every 256 sample transfer. 

void __attribute__((__interrupt__)) _DMA0Interrupt(void);
DMA interrupt service routine performs IIR filtering on the data buffer.


## Hardware Used

- dspic33ep512gm710(https://www.microchip.com/ma330035) /dspic33ep512mu810 (https://www.microchip.com/MA330025-1)/ dspic33ep256gp506 (https://www.microchip.com/MA330030) PIM
	
## Software Used 

- MPLAB速 X IDE v5.50 or newer (https://www.microchip.com/mplabx)
- MPLAB速 XC16 v1.70 or newer (https://www.microchip.com/xc)


## Reconfiguring the project for a different dsPIC33E device:

The Project/Workspace can be easily reconfigured for dspic33ep512gm710/dspic33ep512mu810/dspic33ep256gp506 device.
Please use the following general guidelines:

a. Change device selection within MPLAB速 IDE to dspic33ep512gm710/dspic33ep512mu810/dspic33ep256gp506 device of
   your choice by using the following menu option:
   MPLAB X>>Configuration drop-down option>><Listed Device Configuration>

b. Re-build the MPLAB速 project using the menu option:
   MPLAB X>>Build Main Project

c. Download the hex file into the device and run.
